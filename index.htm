<p>Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister gave a commitment that she would treat Scotland as part of a union of equals. Yet last night, she pressed ahead with a power grab in direct opposition to Scotland's elected Parliament.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister silenced Scotland's voice. Having broken constitutional convention and plunged Scotland into a constitutional crisis, will the Prime Minister now commit to bringing forward emergency legislation, so that the will of the Scottish Parliament can be heard and, more importantly, respected?</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="Theresa-May-1">Theresa May (Prime Minister)
<p>Can I say to the right hon. Gentleman that we do expect that the outcome—and it will happen—of the whole process of Brexit is going to be a significant increase in Holyrood's decision-making power.</p>
<p>It is not the case that this is in any way a power grab. Over 80 areas of responsibility, of decision-making, are going to flow direct to Holyrood. Only the SNP could say that getting 80 areas—where they get more areas where they're going to take decisions—was a power grab. If he wants to be concerned about the process this House has followed in relation to the legislation, his real question should be why it was the Labour Party, who manoeuvred last night, used procedural manoeuvres, to ensure there was no debate about the amendments that referred to Scotland.</div>

<p>Mr Speaker, I really hope that the people of Scotland listened very carefully to what the Prime Minister said. The reality is that powers enshrined under the Scotland Act 1998 are being grabbed back by this House—it is a power grab—and MPs from Scotland were not given the courtesy even of being allowed to debate the matter last night. It is a democratic outrage. The people of Scotland will not be disrespected by this Parliament. In the circumstances, given the disrespect shown, I have no option but to ask that this House now sit in private.</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-3">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>I am not hearing that at this time, and I am not obliged to do so—that is my clear understanding.</p></div>

<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-4">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>Order. The right hon. Gentleman can resume his seat. I will happily take advice, but I do not think I am obliged to hear the matter at this time.</p>
<p>I think the relevant Standing Order requires that the matter be put, if it is to be put, forthwith—[Interruption.] Order. It might be for the convenience of the House for the matter to be addressed at the conclusion of Prime Minister's Questions, and if the right hon. Gentleman, who had not signalled to me his intention to do this now, wishes—[Interruption.] Order, order. I am always grateful for the moral support of the right hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry), even when chuntered from a sedentary position. I realise it is done for my benefit, but I think I can handle the matter. We could have the vote now, or it could be taken at the end. If the right hon. Gentleman wishes to indicate a desire to conduct such a vote now, so be it.</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="Ian-Blackford-4">Ian Blackford
<p>I beg to move, That the House sit in private.</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-5">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>My advice—I have had a mixed sequence of advice—[Interruption.] Order. This has not happened before. [Interruption.] Order. My view is that it is better for the vote to be conducted—[Interruption.] Order. My view is that it is better for the vote to be conducted at the conclusion of questions to the Prime Minister.</p></div>

<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-6">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>Order. I always admit of the maximum number of votes and Divisions, as the right hon. Gentleman should know from his experience in the House, and I hope that he will trust that I know of what I speak. There can be a Division, and it will be at the end of questions, not now. That is the end of the matter. I call the Prime Minister.</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="Theresa-May-2">Theresa May (Prime Minister)
<p>Mr Speaker, might I ask—</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="Ian-Blackford-6">Ian Blackford <span class="rose">rose—</span>
<p></p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-7">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>No, resume your seat, Mr Blackford. [Interruption.] No, you are not moving anything. Resume your seat!</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="Ian-Blackford-7">Ian Blackford <span class="rose">rose—</span>
<p></p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-8">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>Resume your seat. No, no. Mr Blackford, resume your seat. No, no. Resume your seat. No, no. Resume your seat. [Interruption.] Order, order. The House will have heard very clearly—[Interruption.] Order, please. The House will have heard very clearly my acceptance that there can be a vote on this matter—</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="David-Linden-1">David Linden (Glasgow East)(SNP)
<p>Now!</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-9">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>Order.</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="David-Linden-2">David Linden
<p>Now!</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-10">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>Mr Linden, I say to you, and I say it in the kindest possible spirit: do not tell me what the procedures of this House are. I am telling you that there can be vote at the end of questions, and not now. I am not—</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="Ian-Blackford-8">Ian Blackford <span class="rose">rose—</span>
<p></p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-11">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>No, no, Mr Blackford. Order, order.</p>
<p>Under the power given to me by Standing Order No. 43, in light of the persistent and repeated refusal of the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford) to resume his seat when so instructed, I order the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw immediately from the House for the remainder of this day's sitting.</p>
<p>The Speaker ordered Mr Blackford, Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, to withdraw immediately from the House during the remainder of the day's sitting (Standing Order No. 43), and the Member withdrew accordingly.</p></div>
<div class="speaker" id="John-Bercow-12">John Bercow (Mr Speaker)
<p>Order. [Interruption.] Order! Mr Jayawardena, you are a very jocular fellow, but you are a little over-excitable today. Calm! There is a long time to go. [Interruption.] Order. I say only to the House, what a pity that the Scottish National Party Members have left the Chamber, because some of them have questions on the Order Paper, and, as colleagues know, I always like to get to the end of the Order Paper. They would have had their chance, and they have lost that chance by their own choice.</p>
<p>I call Mr Luke Hall.</p></div>
